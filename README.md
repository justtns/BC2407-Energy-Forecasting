# BC2407-Energy-Forecasting

## Overview

This project aims to forecast the short-term day-ahead net demand energy in Estonia, for possible usage in Singapore. Utilizing machine learning and data analysis techniques, we predict energy consumption patterns and solar production to assist in energy management and optimization strategies. This project is part of an academic group project for Nanyang Technological University's course BC2407.
